# README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version

* System dependencies

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions

* ...

This is POC code only.  The premise of this is that it is a Todo list with tasks however this code only shows the nested
Todo items in javascript, it makes no attempt to save the tasks associated with it.
requires:
bootstrap-sass
simple_form
jquery-rails
cocoon
